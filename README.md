# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice
## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions to algorithmic problems. Main languages are C++ (sometimes python). \
Topics included:
1. Basic Algorithms:
    * Sorting: kattis/sortofsorting
    * Binary Search: VNOJ/nksgame

2. Stack, Queue, Deque:
    * Stack: kattis/evenup, SPOJ/ONP(transform algebraic expression into RPN)

3. Two pointer: VNOJ/nksgame

7. Graphs:
    * BFS: LQDOJ/4601(counting connected components)
    * FloodFill: SPOJ/UCV2013H
